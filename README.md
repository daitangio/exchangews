exchangews
==========

Proof-of-Concept of Exchange WebService API.
To be kind, it opens also a Tray icon (if possible).


Use 

	gradle bootRun
	
to start the demo then point your browser to

http://localhost:8080/test


Eval also exjello

https://code.google.com/p/exjello/

because EWS urls are not open by default and it seems a very rough way
